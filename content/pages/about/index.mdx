Hi!

I'm Noah Burroughs. I'm interested in all things Computer Science. I'm currently learning and especially interested in Gatsby, React, MongoDB, and GraphQL. Besides that, I am an avid supporter of Open Source and technology/innovation for the social good.

When I'm not busy with any of the aforementioned, I enjoy spending time outstide - hiking, camping, and swimming. I'm also interested in [hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#:~:text=Hydroponics%20is%20a%20type%20of,solutions%20in%20an%20aqueous%20solvent.) and would love to have a large setup in my home some day!
